This game is one of only a handful that uses a mounted lightgun instead of a regular analog mounted gun.  You would think that mame-wize it would be more autehntic to use an analog gun, but as the game doesn't have any calibration (since it's optical) it is reccomended that you use a standard lightgun for this game.
