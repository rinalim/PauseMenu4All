The cpo depicted a simple arrow pointing up for the button label.  Upon research I found that this button makes you go down the hill faster.  I modified the caption accordingly to avoid confusion.  For left and right, the cpo shows a picture of a skiier going left and right respectively.  I added the 'ski' part of the caption to prepare for the upcoming icon support in the viewer.  As the game doesn't have a true caption, this shouldn't be any less accurate.
