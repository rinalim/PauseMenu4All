This game was shipped out the door with a 8 way optical joystick.  The joystick behaved exactly like a regular 8 way joystick except it was constantly failing.  It was so bad that Stern recalled the orignal joystick and offered free leaf replacments to all the owners.  So for the history books this game didn't use a regular 8 way, but in actuality it did 99 percent of the time.
