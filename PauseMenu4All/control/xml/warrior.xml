Warrior had two top fire style joysticks, one per player.  Moving the joystick would move your knight.  Moving the joystick while pressing the button swings the knights sword.  You cannot move and fight simultaneously.  Movement directions are relative to the screen, not the direction the night is fighting.  ie: Left is always toward the left of the screen. The knights are almost always facing each other.
