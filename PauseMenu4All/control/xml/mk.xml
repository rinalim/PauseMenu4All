Mame uses the jamma standard for button numbering and thus all of the mk games are completely off.  The games buttons were arranged in a cross pattern with block the center of the 'X' high and low punch on the left and high and low kick on the right respectively.  It is highly reccomended that you wrie ctrlr files for these gmaes if you intend to play them.    Also there is actually a second block button used for sf2 conversions but it alternates between broken and half working in the mame source.
