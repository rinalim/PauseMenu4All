This is a two in one cabinet with two games in it.  The control panel is split in half....  on the left is two directional buttons (Left,Right) and a button (Fire). These inputs are actually wired to the controls on the right side of the panel.  These controls are a 4 way jostick and a button (gas).  This seems like a huge waste of control space, but I suppose at the time, generic panels seemed silly.
