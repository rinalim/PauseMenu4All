Editor's note:  The control panel on this gmae labels the buttons simply as 'A' and 'B' but I felt it would be ok to simply put the actual functions as described in the flyer.  As this game was often sold as a conversion kit, we can assume that the flyer used the labels 'A' and 'B' because that is the 'jamma standard' labeling scheme.  A = Normal shot, B = Special Weapon / Attack
