This game lacks labels for the buttons, even on the official cpo and in the manual.  These are simply the actions they do.    Trivia:  The cpo of this game has 'I'm Bad!' graffiti on it which is a tribute to the game BadDudes, relased by the same company eariler that year.  In that game the character would yell the phrase at the end of each level.
