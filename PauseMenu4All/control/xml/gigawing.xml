Normal shots are made by tapping on the 'Shot' button.  If you hold it down (and you are recharged), you get a temporary 'Reflect Barrier' that reflect all the ememies' shots back at them.  You don't have a max number of times to use the reflect barrier, except there is a fairly short recharge time before you can use it again.    The 'Force Bomb' button is like most shooter's bomb buttons (you have limited number bombs &amp; one bomb is stronger than a normal shot).
