The lighted trivia buttons are actually blank, as is the contorl panel overlay.  The game itself has arrows pointing down to the appropriate button.  Also note that buttons a-d also act as the star buttons, again with an arrow pointing towards which is which.  (A = 1 player game, B= 2 players, ect)
