1 &amp; 2 are the red team, players 3 &amp; 4 are the blue team. If one person plays per team, he calls all the plays. If two people team up and play on the same team: On the offense, players 2 &amp; 3 call the play and control that team's quarterback. On the defense, players 1 &amp; 4 call the play. The action button does everything: pass, handoff, kick, punt, jump, select play. To kick or punt farther, you have to hit the action button quickly.
