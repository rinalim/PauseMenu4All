This game had a control panel that repliactes real pinball controls.  It even had a section you could nudge in the front and a plunger.  The plunger appears to be digital, but since it really adds to the feel of the game, I tacked on the 'other' flag.  The hardcoded defaults for the flippers are left ctrl and right ctrl. It is suggested that you place a videopin.ini in your personal ctrlr folder and remap them to match visual pinball defaults.
