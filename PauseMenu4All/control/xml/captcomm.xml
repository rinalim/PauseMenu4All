Pressing attack and jump performs a special.  This game is basically a capcom ripoff of tmnt and the controls are similar.  The only difference is the use of a very rare two-sided, circular, 2-in-1 button (unlabeled btw) instead of two regular buttons.  It should also be noted that this game can be changed from 2 player up to 4 player in the dipswitches and just like tmnt when you have it in 4 player mode players can't select their characters.
