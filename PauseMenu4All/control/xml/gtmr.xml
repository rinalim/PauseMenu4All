IMPORTANT NOTE:  This game has several options regarding the control type.  It has an optional brake pedal/button as well as the option to play the game with either a 270 wheel or an 8way joystick.  The controls shown here are the ones used on the dedicated model.  Notice the lack of the brake pedal.  It seems that the brake pedal was used in conversion kits as the dedicated cabinet didn't have one.
