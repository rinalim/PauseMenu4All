This is a bootleg pcb that contains many classic vertical arcade games.  Because of this the 'alternating play' flag is invalid and will vary from game to game.  The game kit is a pcb only and thus lacks any official labels.  The manual for this version lists the buttons as 1P-S1 thru 2P-S3.  However, these are simply the jamma pinouts.  Every control panel overlay manufacturer that has since released a overlay for this unit has either left the labels blank or labeled them A, B and C respectively.
