In the versions in mame, there aren't seperate start buttons.  The shoot button doubles as the start button.  Mame's driver, however, includes normal seperate start buttons; they don't work.  However, it seems like there were versions of this game that had the normal seperate start buttons.  There also is a 3 player version.  The Mame driver includes player 3 inputs in the 2 player game even though they aren't used.
