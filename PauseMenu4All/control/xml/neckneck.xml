Even though this game allows 6 players, it is wired to a single player layout in mame, due to the odd layout.  Each numbered button represents a horse a player can control.  it also doubles as a start button for that player.  All the button does is jump.  There is also a global start button that starts the race without giving others time to join.  This is mapped to player 1 start in mame.
