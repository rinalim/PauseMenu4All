As this game is a taito game, it is generally sold as a convrsion kit with the buttons mounted in a 'double dragon' layout with the punch/kick buttons at the bottom of the triangle.  Pressing punch and jump at the smae time does a special move.  Also the offical cpo doesn't have any labels for anything.  This is based on parts of the manual and documentation for teh game.
