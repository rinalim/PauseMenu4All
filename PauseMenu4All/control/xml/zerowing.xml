Control wise this game is pretty standard, but the game's claim to fame is the wording of the translated text, or more accurately the poor wording of the translated text.  This is commonly referred to as 'Engrish'  Ever wondered where the 'All Your Base Are Belong To Us.' line comes from?  It's this game.  So for a good laugh check it out.  All your controls are belong to us!!!!
