The NeoGeo Mvs system was a generic cabinet that could have games swapped out very easily, similar to console games. There was a single game version, a 2 game, 4 game, and 6, game version. The multi-cart versions had buttons to switch to a new game prior to inserting your quarter.  As of this writing, this feature is unemulated in MAME.   They all used the same control layout and relied upon inserts to explain to the consumer what button was what. Also 99% of the neogeo games started with a 'How to Play' screen upon starting the game.
