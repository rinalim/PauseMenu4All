There are two button on each stick (trigger and thumb buttons).  The thumb buttons are to rotate the tanks' turrent if you bought the ability to rotate (and it's not damaged).  The right trigger is the normal fire button, the left trigger button is to fire the special weapon.  If you have different types of special weapons, the start is used to switch between the different types.  The odd numbered buttons are the triggers and the even numbered ones are the thumb switches for the left and right joysticks respectively.  Note:  If you have cheats enabled the game inputs are hacked to use a 4way joystick as the controls. There isn't an option to turn it off in the cheat menu, so if you wish to play the game correctly, turn cheats off.
