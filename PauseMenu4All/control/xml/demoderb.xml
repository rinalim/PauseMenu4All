OTHER: This game had a 2-way joystick as the forward/reverse shifter.  Unlike Hi/Low shifters that have only two positions, the Demolition Derby shifter has a Forward, a Reverse, and a Neutral (centered, not labeled) like a 2-way (v) joystick. However, Mame emulates the shifter as buttons 1 &amp; 2, and does not use the 2-way joystick.  The start button is labeled 'Restart' on the CP.  The game comes in 2 player standup and 4 player cocktail, and switches between the two with a dipswitch.
