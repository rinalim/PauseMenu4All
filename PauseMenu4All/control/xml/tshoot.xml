The Grenade Button is actually mounted on top of the machine gun.  Technically it counts as a part of the gun, but the button itself is a stock lighted button.   This game had an interesting gimmick where feathers were blown in front of the screen between two layers of plexi if a round was successful.  Somone should take advantage of mame's switchable artwork system and re-create this effect via a series of feather animations.
