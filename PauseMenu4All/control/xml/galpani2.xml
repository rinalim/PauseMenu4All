This game didn't actually label the button and in all the docs it's referred to as button 1, however it is clear what this button does.  I labeled it 'cut' to avoid confusion as 'button 1' may seem like a parsing error to the average viewer.  Also take note that the pcb has inputs for three physical buttons and they are emulated in mame, but only the first is used.
