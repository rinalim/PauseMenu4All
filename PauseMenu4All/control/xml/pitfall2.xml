The actual cpo for this game didn't have a label for the button, nor a visual hint of what it's for.  Also the manual doesn't explicitly say that the button is the 'jump' button. This is probably due to the fact that the pitfall series is one of the most popular in early gaming history and you'd have to live in a cave not to know that the button is for jumping.  ;)
