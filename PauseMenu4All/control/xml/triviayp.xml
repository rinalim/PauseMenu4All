When a question is asked, a possible answer is displayed.  You either press correct to select the given answer, or press incorrect until the correct answer is displayed and then press correct to confirm.  Mame has a bunch of extra inputs defined, but all you should be concerned with are the 'red' (incorrect) and 'green' (correct) buttons.
