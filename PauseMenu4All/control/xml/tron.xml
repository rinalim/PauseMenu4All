The joystick in this game was unique.  It was an 8-way leaf joystick with a larqe actuator and a diagonal 4-way restrictor making it possible (but difficult) to hit the diagonals.  The 4-way mode was useful for the Tanks stage, and necessary for the Light Cycle stage.  Controls worked as follows: Light Cycles: The joystick controls the direction of travel and the trigger controls the speed of the bike. Grid Bugs: The stick controls the movement of your character and the spinner controls the direction of fire. Tanks: The stick controls the movement of your tank and the spinner controls the direction of fire. MCP Cone: The stick controls the movement of your character and the spinner controls the direction of fire.
