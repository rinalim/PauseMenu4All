Mame includes buttons 2 &amp; 3, but they are not used.    The original game has the hop button mirrored on both sides of the joystick.  The left side jump button is also 1 player start button; mame emulates this as two buttons, button1 and start1.  The right side hop button is also 2 players start button; mame emulates this as only the 'start2' button, even though pressing mame's start2 button also makes RoadRunner hop.  The original joystick was a Hall Effect joystick: an analog joystick that used magnetics to vary the resistance instead of the usual POT.
