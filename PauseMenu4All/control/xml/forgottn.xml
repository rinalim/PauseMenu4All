The spinners also was the fire button.  The spinner rotates the direction the character shoots.  The players can buy power-ups; when they get a shooting power-up the character gets a floating shooting platform that rotates with the player.   When the spinner is not pressed and is rotated, the platform rotates around the charcter, staying relative to the direction the character is facing.   When the spinner is pressed and rotated, the platform and character rotate at their own centers.
