The Nintendo Vs. System was released along side the original NES game console. The games it plays are virtually identical.  This is the earliest known mvs cabinet. Almost all Vs cabinets had a layout exactly like the NES at home, with a joystick, A and B buttons, or a zapper.   This cabinet is really two cabinets joined together.  Two pairs of people can play two different games at the same time.
