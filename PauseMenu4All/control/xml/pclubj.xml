Even though the label indicates that this is a 4 way joystick it is really a two way.  The joystick is desginated as a 4 way because the cpo actually had arrows in all 4 directions.    This isn't even a game, it is a photo booth in which users select a overlay and have theri pciture printed with it in front. Considering mame's 'arcade machine only' policy, it is suprising that it is included in mame.
