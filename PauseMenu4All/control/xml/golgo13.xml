The select and enter buttons may very well be useless in the game itself.  Everything is in Japanese it's generally hard to tell with what little is know with this game.   On the original game there was a scope you looked through that contained a small lcd with a closer view.  In mame a 'zoom button' was hacked in.  There is no telling if that was an original option or not.
