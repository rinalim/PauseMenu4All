The distinction of left and right on these labels isn't which limb you use, but describes the position of the buttons on the control panel.  Each player has two arm and leg buttons and they both do different things, even though they are labeld different.  On the original control panel the arm buttons are on the top row and the legs are on the bottom with the head button centered, above both rows.  So to play this game properly, some remapping will probably be required.
