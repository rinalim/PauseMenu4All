The trackball itself is actually labeled 'Pass &amp; Movement Control.'  The original game had a led counter on the control panel that displayed the currently select play number.  In mame this is simulated by a tiny, tiny little orange character on the bottom left of the screen.  This really needs to be replaced by some artwork files to make it a little bigger and easier to understand.
